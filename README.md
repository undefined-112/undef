# Undef

Just the initial result of doing the getting started guide with react-native app.

# IOS setup

Development team is required for running the app on a real device. We use my private one (Viktor Dahl) for this.
To run on ios after cloning, run this in the root directory:

- npm install
- cd ios && pod install && cd ..

These two commands must also be run for each new package added.

## Pre requirements

- Homebrew
- Node
- Know what shell one is using so that you can setuo your path variables accordingly for android.
